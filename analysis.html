<h2>Analysis - A Christmas Film for Adults, Too</h2>
<p>One of the questions I pondered when preparing for this is the following: Is this a kid’s Christmas movie exclusively or does it go beyond that? 
If you read some of the original reviews, you would assume this is a pure kiddy movie. <em>‘The New York Times’</em> presented a particularly scathing account trying to prove this point:
</p>
<q>
'The Muppet Christmas Carol' is not one of those clever children's films that keep adult escorts from gazing longingly at the exit signs. What you expect -- Muppets -- is pretty much what you get. 
There's no great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. 
But there is a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand.
(Janet Maslin, <em>The New York Times</em>, Dec. 11, 1992).
</q>

<h3>The Impact of Real-Life Death</h3>
<p>So, in case it is not clear from my review thus far, I completely disagree with this assessment. 
There is plenty of wit, not only - quite obviously - from Dickens’ original prose but from Gonzo’s and Rizzo’s banter alone. 
Also, there are certainly many "ingenious cross-generational touches" in this movie. 
A lot of this has to do with some of the adult subject matter, which is not shunned here. 
For one, the movie boldly deals with death. 
Not only with regards to the resurrection of the Marley’s but also Scrooge’s confrontation with his own possible demise. 
Several reviewers, who are much more familiar with other ‘A Christmas Carol’ adaptations than moi, have pointed out that ‘The Muppet Christmas Carol’ illuminates Tiny Tim’s ill health, and possible imminent death a lot more openly than many other adaptations. 
</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that this is so believably and touchingly achieved, considering the Muppets team, and Brian Henson were not only still reeling from the loss of Jim Henson, but also Richard Hunt, who died of AIDS in January 1992. 
Hunt had been a major influence in the Muppet universe, and came to be best known for voicing Scooter. 
Steve Whitmire, who took over the role of Kermit, shared his anxiety and his eventual release from this, thanks to a dream about Henson providing his blessing on later occasions. 
In fact, as a dedication to Henson, Kermit observes a shooting star, as he gazes up to the sky, while the song ‘Only One More Sleep ‘Till Christmas’ is playing.
</p>

<h3>The Return of Paul Williams</h3>
<p> ‘The Muppet Christmas Carol’ marked the return of Paul Williams, who had previously worked on ‘The Muppets Movie’, writing the Academy Award-nominated song ‘The Rainbow Connection’. 
Williams had gone through the agony of suffering from substance abuse and addiction, completing rehab in 1990. 
To his surprise, he was asked by Brian Henson if he would work on the musical score for this new movie. Williams was not sure if he could do it after believing addiction had killed his career. 
But he decided to take on the challenge and discovered that he could relate to Scrooge’s tale of redemption like nobody else on the production team. 
His experiences are reflected in the lyrics of the songs – particularly in ‘Thankful Heart’ where he could express his emotions of feeling connected to the world around him again, which he had not been able to while he was in active addiction.
</p>
<q>There was a connectedness to the world around me, and a level of gratitude that, to this day, is probably one of the most powerful emotions I’ve ever experienced.</q>
<p>Overall, this summed up his experience working on the music for the movie:</p>
<q>I was longing to live life in a totally new way, one day at a time, trusting that what I needed was within me to get things done. 
And I’m sitting down to write these songs, and I’m writing about Scrooge: a man who’s learning to live life in a whole new way, who’s having a spiritual awakening [laughs]. 
It’s like, okay now, this is my inventory of dealing with where I am in my own life.</q>
<p>It is interesting to read the backstory on this. Not only to ponder how his experience impacted the lyrics, but also to consider the otherwise hidden complex undertones, which may not be apparent on superficial hearing or reading.</p>

<h3>Scrooge - An Addict?</h3>
<p>Scrooge’s story can be viewed as an addiction tale. 
This is most strongly indicated by his compulsive relationship to his money, which renders him incapable of love and other feelings, robs him of empathy for other human beings, and ultimately forces him into social isolation. 
</p>
<p>There is a telling scene in the movie about the creation of 'A Christmas Carol, ‘The Man Who Invented Christmas’ (2017), where Charles Dickens, pondering what Scrooge’s fate in the story should be, tries to explain to his skeptical best friend why Scrooge doesn’t deserve saving – namely, because he is such an awful person. 
After some back and forth, Dickens seems to realize that Scrooge only clings to his money because he has nothing else left, desperately trying to fill a void of his own creation. 
He lost everything because he couldn't resist money, and, in his solitude, clings to his money more desperately. 
Scrooge is essentially trapped in a vicious cycle, not too different from other addictions.
</p>
<p>This surely could be delved into and analyzed more deeply; however, if this is considered, a movie that explores subject matters such as death and addiction is not merely some ‘lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale’. It goes far beyond that simplistic purpose. 
I would argue, remembering, albeit vaguely, how I reacted to it when I watched it throughout my childhood and teen years, then viewing it today as a lot more cynical and life-worn adult. I see it as both – a children’s movie and an adult Christmas movie, respectively.
</p>

<h3>The Great Song Controversy</h3>
<p>The major scene that shifts this movie from being either one or the other is the much-discussed song, ‘When Love is Gone’. 
As a brief overview, this song was written as the turning point in Scrooge’s path to redemption, and also as a counterpart to the ‘Finale: When Love is Found’. 
It provides an important moment in Michael Caine’s performance as well, where his devastation and regret about the choices he made are apparent. 
</p>
<p> Disney chairman, Jeffrey Katzenberg, who had displayed an unusually hands-off approach in the production of this movie, trusting Brian Henson in his directorial debut, and Frank Oz as Executive Producer, demanded the song be removed from the finalized movie. 
It had not been very well received by children in the test audiences, and Katzenberg was worried that the scene was too sad and too mature, interfering with the momentum of the story. 
The compromise was to cut it from the theatrical version but add it back to the VHS (for reference, I remember this being on the VHS that I had, soon after watching it in the movie theater). 
</p>
<p>Over the years, it has been cut from DVD and Blu-ray versions, and the negative went missing, much to Brian Henson’s disappointment. However, the negative was finally found, and the song made its way back to the upcoming 4K version.</p>
<p>On this matter, I can only speak as someone who has seen this movie many times over the years since its original theatrical release. 
I was nine then, and my opinion about this song and my preference on viewing it has shifted since. 
As a child and teen, I found it dreadfully boring and insisted on fast-forwarding ahead of it to get to the ‘fun’ parts. 
At this point, however, the idea of not having this song as part of the story and Scrooge’s emotional development seems wrong and nonsensical to me.</p>

<h3>The Long-Lasting Impact of Katzenberg's Decision</h3>
<p>However, I fully understand Katzenberg’s decision on excluding this scene to make it more palatable for the younger audience – because it does do that. 
The emotions expressed in this song are too complex for most children to grasp, and the song takes away from the immediate and continuous action. 
As someone more interested in the movie’s commercial rather than critical success, focusing on making this a movie enjoyable for children was far more imperative to Katzenberg. 
With regards to overall quality, however, the sharp and uneven cutting of a song that explains Scrooge’s character and past experiences so well is a major downgrade. 
On that ground, the fact that the lack of this song has caused such stir, and controversy is also more evidence the movie ultimately is a lot more than just a children’s movie. 
Moreover, it still ranks highly in the Best of Christmas movie lists, despite its original reviews and mediocre commercial success. 
It must be noted that it was facing extraordinarily stiff contemporary competition from one of the most acclaimed Christmas movie series ‘Home Alone’ and Disney itself at the time of its cinematic release.
The fact that we are still discussing this, goes to show how much depth this movie has beyond its silly ‘Muppety’ exterior.</p>
