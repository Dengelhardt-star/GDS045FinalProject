<h2>About - From Dickens to Puppets</h2>
<p>The Henson company had already begun negotiations with Walt Disney at this point, as the creative limitations of a small, independent company became clear by the end of the 1980s. 
Jim Henson had also expressed his wish that the Muppets live on long beyond himself. 
His death threw more uncertainty into the mix, especially as his son, Brian Henson, showed hesitation in becoming the director of the next project.
Brian Henson had established a remarkable career in his own right with extensive experience as a puppeteer, starting with ‘The Great Muppet Caper’ in 1981. He then became the principal plant performer in ‘Little Shop of Horrors’ in 1986. This culminated in him directing smaller features himself. </p>

<h3>Brian Henson's Rise to the Occasion</h3>
<p>Screenwriter Jerry Juhl had come up with the idea for an adaptation of one of his most cherished books, but pitched it to ABC as a TV movie. 
The original intent was to make it a parody of the source material. 
Within that framework, the roles of the ghosts were meant to be filled by main characters, such as Gonzo and Miss Piggy. 
When the concept started taking on a grander and more elaborate form, Disney offered to produce a full feature film instead, and the distribution of roles also changed.</p>

<p>The idea of incorporating Dickens as the narrator turned out to be the most critical. 
Trying to envision writing the screenplay, Juhl apparently lamented the fact that he could not include Dickens' beautiful prose into the script – unless, of course, he had a narrator who would quote the text of the novel. 
Thinking of which Muppet character would make the most unlikely Charles Dickens, everyone agreed this would be Gonzo the Great. 
Comic relief was added in the form of the snarky, shabby sidekick Rizzo, who also functions as a Greek chorus. 
All of these calculations and innovations are the main contributors to what makes this movie so memorable and astonishing.</p>

<h3>Gonzo and Rizzo's Witty Banter</h3>
<p>Gonzo and Rizzo are arguably the best part of this movie (closely followed by Michael Caine). 
Their cynical and sharp jabs, back and forth, are gratifying to watch. 
It also adds a social commentary to some of the questions and concerns the audience may have, such as the suitability of the more terrifying scenes in the movie for children, or topics that the novella addresses, e.g., when Gonzo voices disgust that Rizzo is eating up all of the apples they are trying to sell, and Rizzo replies “I am creating scarcity - drives the prices up". 
This is a wink at Dickens' defiant criticism of contemporary economic theories, such as those espoused by Malthus (theories that Scrooge embodies).</p>
