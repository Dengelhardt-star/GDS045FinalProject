<h2> The End - Bean Bunny and Scrooge’s Song </h2>
<p>I would be criminally remiss to not elaborate on how this movie stars one of the 20th century’s finest actors of all time, in what I believe is one of his best performances ever: Michael Caine. 
He seems to agree, as he believes this is one of his most memorable roles, and also one of his most challenging, due to the conditions of acting with Muppets, not real actors. 
A fascinating tidbit is that Brian Henson’s direction was so professional that Caine did not realize this was his directorial debut until halfway through the production. 
Another surprise is that Caine had never sung in any significant capacity before - yet, according to everyone involved, he went at it with gusto (embracing his weaknesses, as well as his strengths as he himself describes his acting approach), and delivered a fine and heartwarming performance in a musical capacity as well.
</p> 

<h3>Michael Caine's Vow to Not Do Anything "Muppety"</h3>
<p>The background story on Caine’s casting is enthralling here also. 
When the story was still primarily conceived as a parody, the idea was to cast a comedian, and one of the names that was thrown around was that of George Carlin. 
But ultimately, they approached Michael Caine as someone deserving who had not depicted the iconic role of Scrooge yet. 
Caine’s answer as to how he would approach the role was much to Brian Henson’s delight, and us as viewers can fully attest, Caine stuck to his words:</p>
<q>I’m going to play this movie like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company. 
I will never wink; I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me. 
(<em>The Guardian</em>, December 21st, 2015)</q>
<p>Caine is magnetic and transformative as Scrooge. 
My only complaint is that Caine, despite the first-rate work of the makeup artists, who outdid themselves, especially by providing him with devil-like, bushy eyebrows, is much too handsome to play someone as presumably hideous as Scrooge. 
Realistically, I am relieved that he is though! 
Caine always delivers exquisite work – he deserved his long overdue Academy Award for ‘The Cider House Rules’, a story I have always been fond of, and certainly delivered a surprising performance in ‘Dressed to Kill’. 
But his portrayal in ‘The Muppets Christmas Carol’ hits the nail on the head of the emotions expressed and felt. 
In fact, it is one of my favorite performances ever. Period.</p>

<h3>The Magic of Bean Bunny</h3>
<p>Before I conclude, I would like to point out another absolute favorite element of ‘The Muppet Christmas Carol’ of mine – Bean Bunny. 
Nothing is more heartbreaking (aside from seeing Tiny Tim’s empty chair with the cane beside it) than watching Bean Bunny being flung into the snow by Scrooge, after attempting to garner a shilling for singing a delightful little tune and shivering underneath a measly, brown paper bag in the snow, in a later scene. 
What I wasn’t aware of before researching this review, was that Bean Bunny only became a permanent part of the Muppet universe with this movie, and that his appearances are usually only provided for other characters to mock and humiliate him. 
That is awful. Bean Bunny deserves a lot more love than that!</p>

<h3>Go Ahead and Read the Book</h3>
<p>This finishes the least critical review I have ever written. 
I am not sorry. 
It is a beautiful and timeless tale with characters that feel like family to me. 
That sounds ridiculous but it is not untrue – I grew up in front of the TV for long periods of time, watching ‘The Muppet Show’. 
Something that probably became clear in this review is that my attachment to ‘The Muppets Take Manhattan’ is strong as well. 
But on a broader level, I do believe the Muppets are so popular still because they are cross-generational, and that solemn and thoughtful adult themes are explored and depicted so shrewdly - just with odd-looking and seemingly trivial puppets. 
Takes genius, if you ask me, to successfully combine these two contradictory elements. 
As for the question if this is a children’s or adult movie – at this point, I believe it is more effective as the latter. 
I certainly love and appreciate this movie more now than I ever did before, as a younger person.
</p> 
  <p>Most importantly, I urge you to follow Gonzo's advice if you like this movie:</p>
<blockquote><b>Go ahead and read the book!</b></blockquote>
