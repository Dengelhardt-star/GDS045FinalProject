<h2>Themes – Community and Creaturehood</h2>
<p>We meet Gonzo and Rizzo in their new roles at a Victorian period London marketplace, where, when we pay close attention, we can discover a lot of the many Muppet characters as part of the busy scene. 
It reminds me of the recognition at the end of ‘The Muppets Take Manhattan’, when Kermit and Co. are trying to figure out why their play, which was such a hit in college, is not finding any backers to produce it on Broadway in Manhattan. 
After repeated failure and separation from each other, Kermit suffers an accident that causes amnesia, and Piggy thinks he is cheating on her (have you ever thought about how adult some of the themes in these supposed kids’ movies truly are? It is no different in this movie!). </p>

<h3>'The Muppets Take Manhattan' Connection</h3>
<p>Kermit views the new acquaintances his buddies have made in New York, and suggests that what was missing from the play was a greater wealth of characters – one could be tempted to use the word ‘diversity’. 
No big surprise, Kermit is proven right. 
Implementing these changes, everyone celebrates a major success as a result. 
I would argue this wealth of unusual and diverse characters is exactly what makes the beginning of ‘The Muppet Christmas Carol’ so compelling and winning. 
It is fascinating to examine the strange creatures that are part of the Muppet universe - and, realistically, part of the typical 19th-century city market. 
These are a few of the ones I detected: pigeons, fish, turkeys, cats, lobsters, bears, pigs, cockroaches, mice, rats, and feral cats. 
Oh, and, of course, the singing vegetables that also pop up in another scene, with the Swedish Chef. 
Adding frosting on the cake, in the last scene, there is a nod to Dickens’ much discussed line, “a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar”, by featuring some lobsters hanging out of the windows of buildings, and joining in the celebration of Scrooge’s redemption.
</p> 
<h3>Diversity Dictates the Story World</h3>
<p> Now, to further exemplify how marvelous this movie is for the story world, these animals, insects, and whatever else, that many of us would, understandably, consider to be vermin and pests which deserve shunning, are all humanized in this scene. 
They are presented as part of the vibrant and warm culture of this city, and its marketplace. 
The mice have sweet little voices, begging for some cheese in questionable English grammar, and crocheting clothes for each other on Christmas Day. 
The feral cats are singing along with them, and so are the cockroaches. 
This is a brilliant way to prepare for the icy cold atmosphere which Charles Dickens described so eloquently in the novella. 
The idyllic harmony is disrupted when the human protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge dramatically enters the scene. Rizzo comments on this, in case we did not pick up on the contrast - “Geez, is it getting cold in here?” 
</p>
<h3>Man in Black</h3>
<p>Michael Caine, with his typical acting prowess, makes his entrance gloriously, and the song that follows, ‘Scrooge’ is catchy and cheeky, yet powerful. 
Caine stands out first of all because he is much taller than the little Muppets and even the humans in the scene – he is 6.2 ft tall after all. 
Unlike the other colorful creatures, Scrooge is dressed in black. The play with colors in the movie is interesting to observe – towards the end, when Scrooge is redeemed (hopefully, this does not come as a spoiler!), an action is taken to visually both lift Scrooge out of the crowd but also serve to help him fit in with the other characters, finally becoming a part of their community. 
Since I am hopeful you revisit this film thanks to this review, you will see what I mean. 
It is a clever tactic. 
To conclude this point: While the city creatures are being humanized, Scrooge is dehumanized, due to his unkind deeds in the past and present; he is secluded from normal society, and he embraces this isolation until he sees the light (literally and figuratively) and is redeemed. 
There is another scene where Scrooge is referred to as an ‘unwanted creature’, and is brutally mocked, much to Scrooge’s dismay and surprise. 
Needless to say, the scenes with the Ghost of Christmas Future add to the depiction of Scrooge as some wretched, cold, and unworthy being.
</p>
<h3>Dark Story Undertones</h3>
<p>This is the first Muppet feature film production (Christmas Carol was overall the fourth, and the first after several years) in which a human rather than Kermit is the main protagonist.
But we get to enjoy Kermit's performance soon enough, when we are introduced to him as Scrooge’s mistreated, underpaid, and overworked but hopeful accountant, Bob Cratchit. 
While he represents a lonely figure in the office in the novella, liberty is taken to add a group of outspoken and feisty rats - so memorable, working in the kitchen in ‘The Muppets Take Manhattan’ – and they provide for plenty of brazen comments and hearty laughs, much needed in Scrooge’s dreary office. 
Another freedom taken in a production that is surprisingly true to the source material, partly because - according to Henson about 95% of Gonzo’s utterances are directly from the book - Scrooge’s former business partner, Marley, is duplicated into a pair of brothers, so that they could be played by Statler and Waldorf. 
The scene where they make their appearance is a real triumph musically and dramatically, and unnerving for the young viewers. 
This fact does not go unnoticed by Rizzo, when he questions Gonzo on the suitability of the material for children to which Gonzo dryly responds that is it is fine because this is culture. 
These little side remarks are one of the factors that make this movie so lovely, especially after the initial viewing, where some of these quick quips may be missed.
</p>
<h3>The Joy of Christmas Present vs. The Tragedy of Tiny Tim</h3>
<p>Christmas Present is a new and charming figure added to the Muppet universe. 
He performs what some consider to be the best song of this movie, and one of the most excellent of all of the Muppet movies: ‘It Feels Like Christmas’. 
It certainly is a superb and spirited song that provides satisfaction for a viewer of any age, and some of the movies most cheerful and uplifting footage, sorely needed to counteract some of the darker and more depressing scenes shown. 
Not surprisingly, the tear-jerking moments come upon us when we are introduced to Tiny Tim. 
Again, color is used well and skillfully here. Not only are we cued into the fact that something is wrong with this precious little frog, as it descends into a coughing fit, and is carried by his father, because he has a walking disability (in a feat of showing a full-figured Kermit walking which proved to be a major puppetry challenge), but Tiny Tim’s green is coloring is also of a sicklier nature, compared to the other two frogs. 
Needless to say, if your eyes have not teared up at this point, at the prospect of him not surviving, they might very well as the story goes on. 
The subject matter, like in the book, gets much gloomier, and so do the continuing scenes when the Ghost of Christmas Future arrives.</p>
